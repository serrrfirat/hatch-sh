# Task 10: Code Review Mode via /review — Evidence

## Implementation
- Created: src/lib/codeReview.ts (buildReviewPrompt pure function)
- Created: src/lib/__tests__/codeReview.test.ts (10 tests)
- Modified: src/hooks/useChat.ts (/review interception)

## Features
- /review collects git diff for current workspace
- Sends diff + review prompt to agent
- /review path/to/file.ts scopes to specific file
- Edge cases: no workspace, getDiff fails, empty diff

## Test Results
- 10 new tests pass (304 total)
- Commit: 018ff2a
