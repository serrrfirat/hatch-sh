# Task 13: Worktree Lifecycle Management — Evidence

## Implementation
- Modified: src-tauri/src/lib.rs (WorktreeLifecycleManager + Tauri commands)
- Modified: src/stores/repositoryStore.ts (use lifecycle manager)
- Modified: src/lib/git/bridge.ts (worktreeCreate, worktreeRemove, etc.)

## Features
- Worktrees locked on creation (git worktree lock --reason active-agent)
- Worktrees unlocked and removed cleanly on archive
- App startup runs repair + prune
- Duplicate branch rejection
- Crash recovery cleans up .git/index.lock
- Health status: healthy, orphaned, locked, corrupted
- Tauri commands: worktree_create, worktree_remove, worktree_repair, worktree_list

## Test Results
- cargo test passes
- pnpm vitest run: 313 tests pass
- Commit: 8f8bc61
