# Task 17: Parallel Workspace Chat Routing — Evidence

## Implementation
- Modified: src/stores/chatStore.ts (activeStreamingWorkspaces, loadingByWorkspace, workspace-scoped actions)
- Modified: src/hooks/useChat.ts (workspaceId parameter, background notifications)
- Created: src/stores/__tests__/chatRouting.test.ts (3 tests)

## Features
- Messages route to correct workspace agent by workspaceId
- Background agents continue streaming when not focused
- activeStreamingWorkspaces: Set<string> tracks concurrent streaming
- loadingByWorkspace: Record<string, boolean> per-workspace loading state
- Desktop notifications via Notification API on background completion
- No message cross-contamination between workspaces

## Test Results
- 3 new tests pass (379 total)
- Commit: f44ff99
