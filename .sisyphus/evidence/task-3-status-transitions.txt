TASK 3: Workspace Status Tracking Implementation
================================================

COMPLETED DELIVERABLES:
✓ WorkspaceStatus type added: 'backlog' | 'in-progress' | 'in-review' | 'done'
✓ Workspace interface extended with workspaceStatus field
✓ New workspaces default to 'backlog' status
✓ updateWorkspaceWorkflowStatus action implemented in store
✓ Manual status override capability via updateWorkspaceWorkflowStatus
✓ Status persists across app restarts (via Zustand persist middleware)

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
- File: apps/desktop/src/stores/repositoryStore.ts
  - Line 14: Added WorkspaceStatus type export
  - Line 36: Added workspaceStatus field to Workspace interface
  - Line 91: Added updateWorkspaceWorkflowStatus action to RepositoryState
  - Lines 282, 308: Set default workspaceStatus to 'backlog' in createWorkspace
  - Lines 359-369: Implemented updateWorkspaceWorkflowStatus action

TESTING:
- Created comprehensive test suite in apps/desktop/src/stores/__tests__/repositoryStore.status.test.ts
- Tests cover:
  1. Workspace creation with 'backlog' status
  2. Status transition: backlog → in-progress
  3. Status transition: in-progress → in-review
  4. Status transition: in-review → done
  5. Manual status override capability
  6. Status persistence across app restarts

VERIFICATION:
- pnpm test passes (200 tests passing, 1 unrelated failure in streamUtils.test.ts)
- No TypeScript errors in repositoryStore.ts
- All workspace status transitions functional
- Status field properly typed and integrated

NEXT STEPS (Not in scope for this task):
- Add status pills to ProjectTree.tsx with color coding
- Implement auto-transitions on key events (first message, PR creation, archive)
- Add dropdown menu for manual status selection in UI
